MyBBcrypt v0.0

MyBBcrypt is a MyBB mod to integrate bcrypt hash functions.
There are many reasons why MD5 isn't secure for password storage anymore. Even with Salts.
Because of this, and because I didn't find any similar projects, I decided to do a hack for MyBB to implement the bcrypt hash function as the main crypto.
